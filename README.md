# Deepfake_detection

🎭 Deepfake Detection using OpenCV & DeepFace

This project is a **Python-based application** that detects potential deepfake content in videos. It uses **OpenCV** to detect faces in each video frame and **DeepFace** to verify them against a reference image. If inconsistencies are found, the system flags the video as possibly manipulated.

🔑 Features:

* 📹 Processes video frame by frame
* 👤 Detects faces using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier
* 🔍 Verifies faces with DeepFace (Facenet model)
* ⚡ Real-time detection and alerts if a video may contain deepfake content
* 🖼️ Supports comparison with a reference image

 🛠️ Tech Stack:

* Python
* OpenCV
* DeepFace
